#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Lands a delivered patch series on the main tree: the coordinator's landing step
# (CLAUDE.md, **Agent workflow**). A developer delivers `git format-patch` files on a base
# commit, one commit each, and reports the tree they reproduce. This script applies them
# with `git am`, checks the result against that tree, runs the gates, and leaves the
# commits in place for the owner to push.
#
#   tools/land_series.sh <patch-dir> <base-commit> <tree-hash> [--dry-run]
#
# It refuses a working tree that is not clean, a HEAD that is not the base commit, a
# branch other than main, a patch directory with no NNNN-*.patch files, a message that
# carries a trailer or whose subject ends with a period, a patch that does not apply, and
# a final tree that differs from the reported one. Each refusal after `git am` started
# resets the branch back to the base, so the tree is left as it was found. `--dry-run`
# applies and checks the chain, then resets to the base without running the gates. A gate
# failure leaves the commits in place and says how to undo them.
